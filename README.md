## Conflict Plan

We will resolve conflict by approaching each other honestly and giving everyone a chance to be heard.

If one person is taking over the project we will approach the individual professionally to include everyone else.

We will be understanding of everyone’s skill level and can adjust the work load and partner programming appropriately.

If members are not adequately contributing we will approach the member professionally and talk about a solution to the problem.

If resolution attempts are unsuccessful we will approach our instructor's to help resolve the problem if no resolution can be made from within the team.

## Git Process

The front end and back end repository will live on GitHub

We will make an organization on GitHub and invite everyone as collaborators.

Git Flow: Have at least two people approve of a merge before merging

Workflow:

- We will have at least two people review a PR
- Whoever was “driving” can merge the PR for that code
- We will merge after a feature is complete
- When its time to merge we will let the entire team know in advance
